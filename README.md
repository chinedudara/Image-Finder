# Image Finder App
##### by Chinedu Dara
<br />  

> An image search app built with react using Pixabay API. I used Google's Material-UI for the UI and i'm loving how sleek and minimalist it turned out :heart_eyes:. 

**Usage is simple:**
1. Enter any keyword into the search bar (Search is triggered onChange)
1. You can limit result count using the dropdown. 
1. Click the :mag: on a result to display the image in a modal.

 _This app was joyfully bootstrapped using Create-React-App and was not ejected_ :blush:
